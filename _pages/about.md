I am a graduate research intern with the [AI Economist team](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/introducing-the-ai-economist-why-salesforce-researchers-are-applying-machine-learning-to-economics/) at [Salesforce Research](https://einstein.ai/), where I work on robust algorithms for reinforcement learning in multi-agent simulations.

My research broadly aims to develop more robust and reliable machine learning systems.
I am particularly interested in:
* Rethinking how we collect data with new algorithms for interactive machine learning, active learning, and domain adaptation.
* Designing more robust ML systems, particularly for ML+Economics use-cases.
* Exploring the mathematical connections between robustness, fairness and learning.

I studied computer science as an undergraduate student at the California Institute of Technology (better known as Caltech), where I worked on machine learning and economics research with some great mentors including [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/).
I've also been fortunate to have interned at leading companies building real world machine learning products, including [dialogue agents at Google](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) and [self-driving cars at Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/).
