I am a computer science PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. I am affiliated with the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) lab, where I am advised by Nika Haghtalab and Michael Jordan.

My research broadly aims to develop more robust and reliable machine learning systems.
I am particularly interested in:
* Rethinking how we collect data with new algorithms for interactive machine learning, active learning, and domain adaptation.
* Designing more robust ML systems, particularly for ML+Economics use-cases.
* Exploring the mathematical connections between robustness, fairness and learning.

I studied computer science as an undergraduate student at the California Institute of Technology (better known as Caltech), where I worked on machine learning and economics research with some great mentors including [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/), [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/), and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/).
I was previously a machine learning research intern with [Nvidia Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/machine-learning-artificial-intelligence/) and [Salesforce Research](https://einstein.ai/the-ai-economist).
I've also been fortunate to have interned at leading companies building real world machine learning products, including [dialogue agents at Google](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) and [self-driving cars at Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/).
